## Previous v4.0 Assembly Information ##

With more people beginning to show an interest in assembling (soldering) their own gruvin9x printed circuit boards, I thought we'd start a wiki page on the topic.

Eventually, this page should contain detailed instructions of where to buy the parts, get the blank PCB board made or purchased ready-made and other relevant information. For now though, ...

Cam (in the UK) has graciously made some videos of his soldering techniques, using a standard iron, which I will here and now formally endorse as the official, 'gruvin9x way'. :-P

Since a picture tells a thousand words and a video streams pictures at 15+ frames per second, here are the links to Cam's two videos ...

Thanks Cam!

There's silk-screen PDFs for the main board and the (gruvin version) sdcard board in `/trunk/pcbv4.0-frozen/assembly` to help with puting the right parts in the right place.

# Patching PCB v4.0 #

For those who have jumped ahead and got themselves one of the few v4.0 boards we had available, here's the patch work needed (as at 2011-09-21) to make your board v4.1 design compatible -- and in fact required to work with the latest (/trunk) code.

**NOTE** that the BC847 transistor in place of D2 is mounted **UPSIDE-DOWN**

There's another patch required for PPM\_IN (trainer port input). I'm working on a better photo. But for now, this is the best focus I can manage, sorry ...

## Second Version IDL2 / SD\_CS Patch Required ##

Here's a photo showing the latest (revised) IDL2 mod, (See [issue 48](https://code.google.com/p/gruvin9x/issues/detail?id=48).)
