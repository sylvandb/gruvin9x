## 9x Add-on Board with built-in Programmer and EL Back-light ##

[SmartieParts.com](http://SmartieParts.com) (Steven / s\_mack on [RCGroups forum](http://www.rcgroups.com/forums/)) designed and sells a really cool, solder-less PCB that includes EL backlight driver, USB programmer interface. The board makes all its connections to your '9X PCB without a drop of solder -- using '[Pogo-pins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pogo_pin)' -- gold plated, spring loaded, electrical contacts. (This is how the factory or retailer makes connection to the board for testing or for firmware upgrade, etc.)

See [here](http://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1338412#post16549680) for some detailed information with images, in the form of an mini-review, by Erazz (of ER9X).

I don't know how SmartieParts gets the price so low -- but I aim to find out! :-D

## Stand-alone EL Driver and EL Panel ##

If you just want an inverter and EL panel to add to your already custom '9X, [SmartieParts.com](http://SmartieParts.com) can sort you out there too. This is [revision 2](https://code.google.com/p/gruvin9x/source/detail?r=2) of Steven's design and is, by all accounts, excellent. The board includes a low-level drive control input, which you can connect directly to PB7 to control the back-light using ER/gruvin9x (and now TH9X, I think) firmware.

See [here](http://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showpost.php?p=16713596&postcount=3265) for information or [here](http://www.smartieparts.com/shop/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=3&products_id=333) to order.

There's also a back-light installation how-to written by Earl in the project documentation folder. See [/doc/Backlight Installation.pdf](http://gruvin9x.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/Backlight%20Installation.pdf).
