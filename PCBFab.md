# Getting your own G9X v4.2d PCB's made #

A Hong Kong based organisation, "ITead Studio" is the cheapest
and most accessible PCB prototyping service we have yet found. They can supply
five (5) HASL (hot air solder levelled) professionally produced and fully silk screened etc
G9X v4.2d PCBs for about USD$61, plus shipping. Shipping costs are typically under USD$10 for
registered air mail.

That's less than USD$15 for each board, landed at your door! Here's how you do it ...

## How to Order five G9X v4.2d Boards from ITead Studio ##

Go to http://imall.iteadstudio.com/open-pcb/pcb-prototyping/im120418010.html

That should be a direct link to their PCB prototyping service, for _2LAYER PCB
LARGER THAN 10CM X 10CM._

You need to select some options. Here's an image of that, which I just did on
their site ...

Once you have paid for your order, ITead will send a confirmation email
containing instructions for sending the Gerber files to them. That amounts to
sending an email to pcb[=at=]iteadstudio[=dot=]com, with the Gerber
files attached. Put your order number in the subject and message body.

Here is a link to the Gerbers files, already in a convenient ZIP file.  [ZIPped Gerber files for ITead](https://gruvin9x.googlecode.com/svn/archive/pcb-v4.2d-frozen/production/g9x_v4-2d_gerbers.zip)

Just send the ZIP as a single file.

That's it!

Time from placing order to receiving the boards (way down here in New Zealand)
is usually inside two weeks. (They come from Hong Kong, China.)
