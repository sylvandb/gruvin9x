# Re-programming Your 9X Radio #

## Two options ##

Two principal options exist for getting gruvin9x into your '9X radio.

### Using Pre-compiled Binary Distributions ###

If you just want to load in the latest firmware version and run, this option is for you. There are however several version of the firmware available, depending on which hardware modifications you've made -- if any.

See the wiki [Flash Guide](FlashGuide.md) page for details

### Compiling from source ###

If you'd like to get a look at the source code, maybe make a few changes of your own, then take a look at [Compiling From Source](CompilingFromSource.md).

Gruvin happens to do all his development work on an Apple Mac. However, Windows and Linux are also fully supported by the compiler toolchain we're using (AVR-GCC and AVRDUDE for physical programming.)
